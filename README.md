# osquery_exporter
Exporter for exporting osquery (https://osquery.io) query results to prometheus

## Installation
Install osquery from https://osquery.io/downloads/ or with your favourite package manager.

Build with go1.15
```
go get github.com/zwopir/osquery_exporter
go build
```

## Configuration
The exporter can be configured via configuration file and commandline parameters.

```
Usage of ./osquery_exporter:
  -config.file string
    	Config file (default "config.yaml")
  -web.listen-address string
    	Address on which to expose metrics and web interface. (default ":9232")
  -web.telemetry-path string
    	Path under which to expose metrics. (default "/metrics")
```

The configuration file is mandatory, whereas the commandline parameters are optional and have reasonable default values.

The configuration file (YAML) defines the queries that are run either via osqueryi or .

```yaml
---
runtime:
  # osqueryi binary. Looked up in PATH if not specified as absolute path
  osquery: "osqueryi"
  # timeout for a single call to osqueryi
  timeout: 10s
  # whether this mode is enabled
  enabled: true

# or define a socket file from a running osqueryd instance
socket:
  path: "/var/osquery/osquery.em"
  timeout: 10s
  enabled: false

metrics:
  counters:
    # a list of counter definitions
    [ - <counter definition> ... ]  
  gauges:
    # a list of gauge definitions
    [ - <gauge definition> ... ]  
  countervecs:
    # a list of countervec definitions
    [ - <countervec definition> ... ]  
  gaugevecs:
    # a list of gaugevec definitions
    [ - <gaugevec definition> ... ]  
```
There are four types of metrics, that can be exported:

### counter and gauges
Counter and gauges are defined as an osquery query that returns a single line with a single element.
Typical queries are `select count(*) as c from <table>;`. The resulting column must me named and referenced in the metric definition:

```yaml
# name of the metric. Directly exported to prometheus (but prefixed with osquery_exporter_).
name: history_lines_count
# metric help
help: "number of entries in the history"
# the query to be executed via osqueryi
query: "select count(*) as count from shell_history"
# reference to the name of the result column
valueidentifier: count
```

It's up to the user to decide if the osquery query result is a counter or gauge. Further information about metric types and labeling recommendations can be found at
- https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/
- https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/

### countervecs and gaugevecs
counter- and gaugevecs are analog counters and gauges, but the query result can (and should) consist of more than one result set.
A single result set must contain label columns which are referenced in the metric definition:

```yaml
name: users_by_shell
help: "number of users by login shell"
query:  select count(*) as count, shell from users group by shell;
valueidentifier: count
labelidentifier:
  - shell
```

### Implicit metrics
In addition to the defined metrics defined via the configuration file, osquery_exporter implicitly creates metrics for
- query duration (type summaryvec with a label "name")
- query status (type gaugevec with a label "name"). A value of 0 indicates an error (including timeout), 1 indicates success.
- number of result sets (SQL lines) per query (type gaugevec with a label "name")
